# Upgrading Armor

In order to get one of the best armors in the game upgraded you'll need to grind for probably 5-6 hours.

Again I would like to reiterate it really is not needed to easily beat the game. 

## Dragon Parts

- It takes at least 40 min per dragon to get the parts to level fierce diety as items spawn every 10 in game minutes.
- In ease of getting items I recommend: scale, shard, horn, fang, then claw
- In order of upgrades it is: scale, claw, fang, horn
- Fangs can sometimes be shot from top with bow, might be worth trying before scale.
- Watch a movie while waiting
- Dodge ice/lightning/flame bursts, staying on the nose helps

## Ice
- 28 min loop, 11 min underground, clockwise, 250-500 elevation
- Leaves Chasm at W Mount Lanayru 
- Enters Chasm at E of Sahasra
- Look W and S of Mount Lanayru
- Equip ruby shield and warm pants

## Lightning
- 35 min loop, 19 min above, 15 below, clockwise, 300-500 elevation
- Leaves Chasm S of Gerudo Canyon
- Enters Chasm W of Popla
- Look S, N, E of Gerudo Canyon
- Look W of Popla
- Equip Lightning Helm or Rubber Suit Level 3 (long questlines I would skip personally)
- Once on the dragon, you can sometimes hang under a spike to not get electrocuted
- You do not get shocked underground if you board at Popla
  - Scale, Shards, Jump off to not get shocked, 10min, Horn, 10 min, Fang, 10 min, Claw

## Fire
- Equip 2 Flame Guard Armors
- 47 min loop, 22 min above, 25 min below, counter clockwise, 500-700 elevation
- Leaves Chasm E of Ulri Mountain, goes North, then West
- Enters Chasm W of Thyphlo, comes from E

# Getting Upgrade Materials

## Hinox
- We need to farm Hinox for: 15 toenails, 15 teeth, 6 guts
- Black Hinox have a 100% drop rate for guts
- Red Hinox only have a 20% for teeth
- You can save before a Red Hinox and reload if it doesn't drop

## Upgrading
To upgrade Fierce Diety to level 3 you need 780 Rupees, I would do the Hinox upgrades before farming lynels.


## Lynels
- We need 6 Lynel Guts
- Silver Lynels have 5k hp and are very tough, but have a 100% drop rate.
- Weaker lynels have lower drop rates for guts, blue (20%) or white (60%).
- It costs another 1500 Rupees to upgrade Fierce Diety to max
