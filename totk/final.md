# Final Dungeon
- Travel to Hyrule Castle and dive into chasm underneath the castle
- Head South, climb up, at the lynel we need to go up to the top behind it, to do so drop down and go left
- Ascend and go through the door, the floor drops out, head east, recall a falling block up, head west and we are there
- Head South and run past ice worms, floor drops out again, glide to bottom
- Head North, there's a big gap, drop down and ascend up to the big guy, keep going North
- It'll turn into the area at the start of the game, use bombs and make your way to Ganon
- Where Ganon was drop into chasm, head south, stop when you get to the next big drop with a red light below
- Place down a fast travel marker, get out, heal
- Cook apples with 1 Sundelion to make food that heals gloom damage so we can heal after the first boss
- Sundelion can be found on sky island next to simosiwak shrine
- I recommend having 8 ruby, 8 topaz, 4 sapphire, 50 arrow, and 20 gibdo bones
- You can get the gems by farming rare stone battle taluses

## Boss Fight (6 ruby, 3 topaz, 3 gibdo)
- Phase 1 - Run away towards camera, shoot ruby left, shoot ruby right, hop on mineru kill boss with gibdo, slap stragglers
- Phase 2 - Shoot 1 ruby, gibdo stragglers
- Phase 3 - Run away, shoot topaz at group of chasers, canon individuals
- Phase 4 - Run away, shoot ruby when safe
- Phase 5 - Run away, shoot ruby, topaz
- Phase 6 - Run away, shoot ruby, topaz

## Ganon (14 gibdo, 4 sapphire, 5 topaz):
- Phase 1 - Gibdo face (8 or so) and sword slice
- Phase 2 - Gibdo face until we have distance (3 or so), rocket shield in middle of room, 4 sapphires (aim at main phantom)
- Phase 3 - Gibdo face until he chases (3 or so), rocket shield in middle of room, 5 topaz/ruby

## Dragon Fight
- You don't take fall damage landing on a dragon, you will take gloom damage walking on scales
- Dive down and glide to a bright red spot on his back, destroy, then jump off and dive to light dragon
- The final piece to hit is on his face, dodge the red balls and sword slice
