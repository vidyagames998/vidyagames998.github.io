# Tears of the Kingdom (TOTK) Walkthrough
This game is easily a 50 hour game, but a lot of time is spent just aimlessly wandering. With this guide I try to concisely explain where to go so you can see what all TOTK has to offer in about 10 hours of your time and not watch any annoying youtube videos.

If the text isn't enough at times I also made [videos that play at 4x and skip loading screens](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NdZ_nQG-NlY&list=PLzJ1je-KFuneDDbK7ZooLfwrZw4yP_YEu&index=1).
