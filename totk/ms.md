# Master Sword and Activating all Tears

## First tear
- Fast Travel to Sinakawak Shrine by Horse Stable
- Run east to campfire with hot air balloon, talk to impa, fix her hot air balloon, talk to her again
- Use the torch and light the fire in the balloon
- Jump out and talk to the right eye

## Getting map of tears
- Fast travel to Pikida fly towards yellow indicator, get orochium shrine
- Take horse rest of way to yellow indicator
- Enter midway, head north east, follow left side, climb up, glide across, climb up, glide across
- Grab shrine, continue North east, touch map

## Tear Locations
- Lindors Brow - NW, top middle
- Pikida - NE, Left Edge Middle
- Thyphlo - E, tip of sword
- Eldin Canyon - S, center of tablet
- Sahasra - W to forest SW corner
- Rabella - SE, left side of sword handle
- Popla - W, left side flower petal
- Gerudo Canyon - NW, chest height on upper snow ledge 
- Gerudo Highlands - NE, middle right edge
- Mount Lanayru - NE, on north edge, light dragon spawns here make sure you have 2 stamina wheels to save time grinding
  - Immediately go to Ulri Mountain, fly SE to flying machine, fly to dragon, hit horn, grab master sword
- Ulri Mountain, E, when you talk to the tear, the light dragon resets again

### Time save
I won't be using light dragon parts, but if you want them and want to save time grinding:
- Immediatley go to Ulri Mountain again and reboard, get scale
- Grab shards off back 
- Wait 10 unpaused game minutes for it to glow again 
- Use bow to shoot fang (shoot front mouth underneath), the item will likely drop to ground, go get it
- If the fang falls you will need to find the dragon again later for claw 

## Finishing Light Dragon Questline
The light dragon flies at about 2000, after falling off you can travel to Mayam and see it, but it'll be too high and far away to catch

- In the top middle of the map is the great hyrule forest, the southeast corner has a chasm, make your way there from Eldin Canyon
- From the chasm paraglide N then NW to the lighted structure, grab the light root, then ascend up to the Korok Forest
- Grab the shrine
- Hestu now moves from Lookout Landing to here
- Go inside the tree and prepare for a tough fight, equip phantom, have plenty of food, bombs, topaz/ruby, and a good triple bow
- Before landing shoot a few bright blooms around the room and land on the North side
- Immediately shoot 3 (9 bombs) to kill the gloom
- When Ganon spawns, shoot 3 topaz/ruby (9), then run into Ganon and then continue behind him to get distance
- Heal, then shoot 2-3 more, finish with bombs if needed
- Fast travel up and talk to the giant tree
- The light dragon should now be flying around 700 in a 112 min loop
- Optional: Check Mayam, then Taunhiy, then Rakashog (NE Gerudo Canyon), then Sihajog and get the missing item

## Note

You can fuse items to the master sword, the master sword throw animation does a ranged attack, the master sword regenerates when broken
