# Great Sky Island
- Grab the broken sword, cut the vines with y
- Talk to hand to open the door and head through
- Only jump into water with stamina or you will die
- Grab the archaic legwear in the chest direclty before heading outside into the light
- Make the jump and land in the pond below
- Follow the path
- Along the way grab a stick and use it to beat the first zonai enemy to death
  - They drop charges which we will convert to wings later
- Talk to the crouched zonai next to the hand statue to get your tablet
- Talk to hand to raise the bridge, head left and jump off into the next pond
- Make your way North to the Yellow indicator at the door of the giant 4 layer upside down pyramid
  - Kill zonai along the way
  - Weapons get more damaged with every swing, they still get damage if you swing and miss
- After the door, the game points you W to a giant rock shaped like an Egg, head there to the Ukouh Shrine.

## Ukouh Shrine
- This shrine gives you ultrahand, which lets you move objects
- The controls are super confusing:
  - L -> Right stick Right to select ultrahand
  - A to Grab onto something
  - Right stick up and down to move it up and down
  - Right stick right and left to move in an arc
  - Left stick strafe with the item and make fine tune movements left/right/up/down
  - Dpad up/down to move in and out
  - R button -> Dpad up/down to rotate 45 degrees vertically
  - R button -> Dpad right/left to rotate 45 degress horizontally
  - L to reset item position
  - A to glue items together when close by showing glue
  - Shake right stick to unglue items

- Use one platform to cross the bridge
- Glue two together to cross next gap
- Grab hook, glue to wood, place it on the rail, and ride it to the end
- Finishing a shrine always heals you

## To In-Isa
- When you exit the shrine you'll be facing South to the next giant rock Egg.
- You can mark it with your scope
- You can also mark the one after on top the snow to the east

- Take the rail to the south east down with another wood hook
- Grab the dead zonai parts, some bundles of wood, and axes
- Take note of the boat design we'll need to make it later
- Use the wood hook to complete the bridge across or cut down trees to make a new bridge
- Grab the bow and head to the blue ghost south
- Keep heading south, use the bow to sneak attack the zonai, R to pull out bow, aim for head shots
- Arrows are relatively rare so use them sparingly
- You can break open boxes for arrows using ultrahand and dropping them from up high
- After killing the zonai group, head west to your first korok
- Along the way grab the green mushrooms, they can replenish stamina, very useful when falling from great heights later on
- Glue a hook to a log and glue the korok to it and ride the rail, then ultrahand him to his friend
- There are 1000 korok seeds in the game that need help and the more you find the more weapons/bows/shields you can carry at once
- Ride the hook down
- Build a 2 log raft and sail across to the in-isa shrine

## In-Isa Shrine
- This shrine gives you fuse, you can pair rocks to weapons and inventory items to weapons for more damage
- Drop broken gear and make rock weapons
- ZL -> Right stick Down -> Y to pair to sword
- Smash broken rocks to proceed
- Smash rock tower for 5x arrows
- Attach firefruit to arrows and shoot leaves up high to get key
- ZR to use Bow -> Dpad Up to attach fire fruit
- Head through door, start fight, use your bow to light the ground on fire and easily kill the boss

## To Gutanbac Shrine
- The next shrine is a ways away, the game gives you a battery, and tells you to go to a cave to the SE
- Smash rocks directly south for 5x arrows
- The zonai group before cave has good loot, you can "fish" by jumping in the pond, fireflies can be grabbed by crouching
- Now is a good time to cook food, there is a limit to how many cooked items you can carry, we won't hit that for a while
- Bat eye's when paired to an arrow make them heat seeking and do head shots automatically
- If you kill frogs they drop bubul gems which if you collect a lot of them can get you good end game armor
- Break the broken rocks to find more sparkling rocks
- Sparkling rocks drop gems
- Gold sparkling rocks drop expensive and very damaging gems, they also respawn every few hours of game time
- Glue three logs together, then attach a fan to make a raft across the lake (using the battery that recharges itself)
- Placing flint and wood bundles together under a pot and striking with a sword can start a fire for you to cook
- Head forward
- Attach a fan to the minecart and head into the cave
- R -> Dpad Up to throw an item, brightbloom seeds give light
- Blue rocks give zonaite, a very large amount can increase your battery a little
- talk to the zonai guy to get a capsule fan
- Make a fan cart to get out

### Detour
- Take your fan cart and use it to get the korok across
- Attach the hook to the minecart and use it on the left rail to get to the top
- Loot the 3 bodies for zonai charges and jump down into the water

- Head to the cave, grab the peppers, and cook them 1 at a time for cold resistance and a good healing item
- Head north
- Fuse the ruby to a shield for permanent cold resistance (we can unfuse it later if need be)
  - Ruby's are hot and warm you up, Sapphires are cold and cool you off
  - Topaz do great shock damage, Opals fused on weapons shoot water to clear sludge
- We'll get more rubies later

- Skip the chuchu zonai fight, it's tough, and head into the cave
- Collect the bombs, don't use them as they are rare and we need them later, world items only respawn every few hours
- Ceiling/wall worms aren't usually worth fighting, they are only weak when their glowing mouth shows, grab the flame shield and head outside and climb the tree branches up to the shrine

- Fly up, fly up, cut the ropes to drop the bridge, fly up into bridge, fly up, fly up again to top

## After Gutanbac

- Grab the warm pants in the tree stump and equip them
