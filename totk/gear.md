Enemies respawn during blood moons, which happen every 2 in game hours.

## Learn to repair items

Most weapons in the game only last for 20-40 swings. Hitting the ground does damage to the weapon, charged attacks damage them quicker. Fuses increase some durability. You'll definitely be repairing items frequently.

- Fast Travel to Ulri Mountain, equip glide suit, glide north west to Momosik shrine
- Place items on ground and have them thrown back at you to have them repaired by octorocks
- Here's a map of 9 of them, they can repair new items every blood moon

- Fast Travel to Rasitakiwak, go to Tarry Town to North, shop can unfuse items
- Unrepairable items can be repaired when fused to repairable items
- You can save farm. Find an octorock, save, upgrade and reload if you don't get an upgrade you want. I'm not a fan of save farming.
- The bow can be upgraded from 3x to 5x.
- There is a silver upgrade, then a gold upgrade for each upgradable weapon, requiring two octorocks to get the most of an item

## Experience

As you defeat hard enemies the world experience changes, enemies get stronger, and the game gets harder. Versions of weapons you find on map and in chests may also get stronger variants. 

## Get better Armor - Fierce Deity Armor (optional)

  - They get easier when you finish the temples and have more health/stamina and better weapons
  - Weapons do not take damage when mounted
 
## Get Money
We are going to farm the rare stone battle taluses. While the diamond, ruby, topaz, and sapphire drop rates appear really low according to the drop tables on the wiki, the numbers lie due to mechanics that guarantee drops and you get a few from each rare stone battle talus. With this strategy can expect to yield about 3k rupees for 15 min of work.

- Ulri Mountain Skyview -> NE to Jochi-iu shrine by stable, continue NE to beach
- Fuse Molduga/Diamond/Horn to Gerudo Spear
- Just N of three pirate ships are three rocks, if you walk on them a Rare Stone Talus boss spawns
- You can climb up its back or ascend through its front, spear the rock on top to death
- Fuse Talus Heart to another spear (zora works best)
- On the bottom middle of the map, there's lake of the horse god and a bridge, another talus is W of the bridge
- From Popla wing south west to dodge storm, then turn south and go to utsushok shrine by horse stable, jump off wing before you are hit by lightning if needed, head S
  - When the gerudo spear is weak swap for other spear, fuse up another spear
  - Paragliding off might help to avoid ground stomp deaths
- Travel back to Utsushok, head East, there's another just N of the small lake
- Travel to Gerudo Canyon, just S is a circle of rocks with another
- Travel to Gerudo Canyon, just N is a waterfall and cave with another
- These respawn every blood moon
- Dropped items sell for lots of money

This can be done much faster after robbies questline when you can fast travel anywhere.

## Arrows

Boxes can be ultrahanded, rotated, and dropped on the ground to get more arrows. You can also buy them from vendors. 

## Recommended Weapon (optional)

Damage calcuations are very weird in this game. 
 - Spears in this game have a 0.75 damage modifier from the number you see on screen, but have a very high attack speed to compensate up for it, which makes them the best at dealing damage. 
 - 1 handed swords are 1.05, 2 handed swords are 0.95
 - Having three attack up armor gets you a total of a 50% damage boost (20%,~30%,50%). You cannot get more than three up damage boost even with food. 
 - A pool of undecayed weapons spawn at ghost statues in the depths based on the region that items from. You can add to the pool by destroying a weapon on the surface and going to that item types location in the depths. 
 - Certain weapons get attack boosts based on an attribute, Gerudo 2x the attachment, Zora 2x the total damage when you are wet (rain, shortly after swimming, throwing splash fruit, throwing chuchu jelly, sidon's shield ability)

With that said the Zora Spear is one of the absolute best early/late game weapons. You can get it very early on by freeing the guy next to the upland zorana tower. It only has a damage of 6, but don't let that deceive you. It has a durability of 40 which is pretty high compared to most weapons. You can fuse it with a rare stone talus heart +33 which you can easily get with the gerudo spear (20 durability) and a dragon horn/diamond, making it a +39 weapon. If make yourself wet the damage doubles to 78. Taking into account your gear it'll do a rapid `(6+33)*2*.75*1.5 = 87.75` damage with good durability. You can make it even stronger by destroying it and getting the undecayed version. After destroying the zora spear by swinging till it breaks, dive in the depths near upland zorana and get the undecayed version from the floating ghost statue, this can be save farmed if you destroyed other weapons, giving you a 12 spear. You can easily get more of these spears by navigating the depths looking for other ghost statues in this area. This spear can also be made +10 stronger by save farming ocotorocks, which also doubles with wetness so its really +20.  After the water temple, it can be upgraded yet again to increase durability with three diamonds and five flint by talking to the guy in Zora town to convert the spear into a Lightscale Trident with 22 strength and 70 durability. Rare stone battle talus hearts add to the durability. Octorocks cannot be save farmed again to give +10 damage as it is now a legendary weapon, but it still can be repaired when attached to other non legendary weapons. This gives you a `(22+33)*2*.75*1.5 = 123.75` on a high damage per second weapon with great durability, using easy to find weapons, and no octorock farming. 

The amount of work you will need to put in to get a better weapon is considerable and are ultimately use case dependent. For example you can get a lynel weapon. First destroy your royal guards claymore and get an undecayed royal guards claymore in the depths, unlock the radiant armor set for 2400 rupees and do a questline, unlock the fairy fountains for upgrades, then farm the materials for upgrades: luminous stone, moldugas, and lynels. While doing so killing the lynels and moludgas significantly progresses the in game experience making the game much harder at end game difficulty enmeies. In general the more strong enemies you kill the harder the game gets. This process will likely take around 8 hours of time, but can yield a much stronger weapon which is really only good for taking out lynels as when mounted on the back of a lynel weapons do not take durability damage. In then end you should have a molduga jaw fused with a perfect royal guards claymore, octorocked to plus 10, durability damaged to last hit, with attack up x3 food, with 1.8x bone proficiency for having the upgraded radiant armor giving you 437.5 damage per strike. Which can kill lynels 4x faster than our spear. If you were to let it break you get 2x and you can do a sneakstrike to get 8x giving you 7000 damage killing even the hardest level lynels in one hit, albeit the hard to acquire sword breaks. Bone proficiency can also boost the lightscale trident if you go through the effort to get the radiant armor set for 442 damage and fuse a molduga jaw. So this weapon does not seem worth the effort to me. 

## Crushing rocks (optional)
Directly west of Eldin Canyon skyview tower is a chest with a cobble crusher in it. A hidden stat bonus causes most rocks to break with 1 hit from it. It's durability is not the best(30 non decayed), but like the Zora spear there are hidden stats and upgrades. To start fusing anything adds +25 durability. The hidden stat does 1.5x the damage to battle taluses. I believe they also take less durability damage from crushing rocks. You can get another undecayed version after breaking it then finding it in the depths. Fusing a rare stone battle talus heart adds higher damage +33 and durability. The two handed sword has a slow damage per second compared to spears but also has a .95 multiplyer vs .75 (1 handed are 1.05), to help get around this difference you can also do spinning charged attacks by holding Y. After the fire temple, in goron city you can upgrade this to a Boulder Breaker (40 durability) with three diamonds to get a 38 base attack. So with a Boulder Breaker fused with rare stone battle talus heart with attack up armor against a battle talus you can do `38+32*1.5*1.5*.95=149.625` which makes for a good alternative to spending spear durability to farm the taluses and isn't very hard to acquire. 

Gold rocks provide diamond, ruby, sapphire, and topaz. Which can sell for high value or make the game very easy when fused to 3x bows. 

Luminous rocks are needed for radiant armor upgrades

Bombs also destroy rocks

## Other Weapons (optional)

There are 15 legendary weapons. I'm not going to cover all these just find youtube guides if you want them. Here are the two I feel worth mentioning.

- After the wind temple. Rito village has the swallow bow which can be upgraded to a great eagle bow with three diamonds which has 3x with good durability
- After the lightning temple, Gerudo Desert has the scimitar of the seven 1 handed sword which pairs well with lynel horns
- After hyrule castle, the gloom weapons you get from defeating phantom ganon are very strong, but only really worth it if you have lots of hearts unlocked as each swing hurts you

## Cooking (optional)

There is a ton of food you can cook in game, save farming can help you figure out what works well and what is not worth it. Some items give mulitiple points. The number of points you need to get level 2 or 3 buffs varies considerably. John Austin has a great video series explaining a lot of the in depth mechanics to this game if you care to learn. In summary this is probably all you will need to know. 

- Mushrooms on the great sky island are great early game heals
- Spicy peppers on great sky island give cold resist, once you fuse a ruby to a shield and have cold pants you wont need these anymore and can use them to heal
- Stamina shrooms and bulbs on the great sky island can save you from needing to teleport when falling with no stamina and can help you reach far away places
- Rushrooms and frogs from great sky island give speed up (combine in groups of 5, frogs are better)
- Apples are plentiful near the Sonapin Shrine and are good for healing once off the island
- Bananas give attack up (found near the south east rain forest and yiga hideouts in depths) but useless with attack up armor
- Endura carrots (found near cherry blossom trees) respawn all your stamina and then some, they won't help you get the master sword, they can be traded for horse upgrades
- Dragon horns are the best to mix with something by far as they give a +30 min duration buff, but they are also needed for feirce diety upgrades, sell for 300 rupees, and give very strong fuse weapons
- Sundelions from the sky islands when cooked with food give gloom heal and are needed for the final boss
- Fireproof lizards (1 point) and smotherwing butterflies(2 points) near the lakes by goron give flame guard when combined with a monster part like a keese wing, although the rudania helm and flame guard armor are much easier to get
- Amiibo give tons of fish that can be cooked for all kinds of stat boosts. You can buy cloned amiibo off etsy and can save and modify the date on your switch to farm all the items in a few hours. 

## Glitches
Depending on how updated your game is there are many ways to duplicate items, food, weapons, and upgrade materials. All of which can save you literal days of grinding. It feels cheap, it's not in the spirit of the game and the glitches that work on the game with the latest patches are not the easiest to do. The current working methods are complex and not nearly as easy to pull off. If you want to learn more you can do so here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=atx72hKDDNY

You used to be able to just shield jump in the air (zl+a), open the menu, hold items, exit the menu, fall to the ground and pick up duplicates. Speedrunners typically open the menu multiple times per jump and can turn 1 item to 23 in seconds. There was also a rupee glitch where you could get negative items and sell them to a shop keep using a horse and memories giving you max rupees in minutes. 

Item duplication aside glitch hunters went crazy with TOTK and you can load in objects from other save files, make indestructable weapons, make never disappearing zonai devices, walk through walls, and attack with multiple weapons at once to name a few. The glitchless speedrun wr is 3 hours and 33 minutes. The glitched version is currently under 40 minutes and can be done blindfolded. The easiest downgrade to version 1.0.0 to do these glitches is to erase your switch entirely and use a physical copy of the game. Otherwise you will need a hacked switch.
