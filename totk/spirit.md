# Spirit Temple

## Getting to start of Spirt Temple
Head to lookout landing and talk to purah

### Shortcut
- From nachoyah take a wing, fly south, mid air wing to 1377, -3341. 
- Dive down to 550, building is at 500, shrine is at 429
- To avoid being hit by lighting remove metal weapons, bows, shields, and armor
- The game does not give you much time at all before a dense fog sets in, dive quickly
- Coordinates only show on minimap so either fly to Rabella and make your way there and set a marker 
- Or open the map, from the sky view find the circular storm on the south east side
- At about 7oclock on the circle is dark mark, place your cursor there, go down a level
- You should be east of the floria river, zoom in as far as you can
- You should see a stick with 3 circles on it
- At the very east end of the stick, place a marker just south in the dark part before the river
